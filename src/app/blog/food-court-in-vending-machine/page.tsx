              Imagine walking up to a single vending machine and having access to meals from four different restaurants. 
              This isn't science fiction—it's the reality that Vendmat has created with our revolutionary "Food Court in a Vending Machine" concept.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Challenge: Limited Variety in Traditional Vending</h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Traditional vending machines have always been limited by space and variety. You might find chips, sodas, or at best, 
              a few sandwich options. But what if employees want Indian cuisine for lunch and Italian for dinner? 
              What about dietary preferences, spice levels, or simply the desire for something different every day?
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Our Solution: The 4-Restaurant Partnership Model</h2>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Vendmat's breakthrough approach partners with exactly <strong>4 restaurants per vending machine</strong>. 
              This isn't arbitrary—it's the sweet spot that maximizes variety while maintaining operational efficiency. 
              Each restaurant rents locker space for a fixed fee, with no commission per sale.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-700/50 border-l-4 border-[#f8650c] p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Why 4 Restaurants?</h3>
              <ul className="text-gray-300 space-y-2">
                <li>• <strong>Optimal Variety:</strong> Covers major cuisine types and dietary preferences</li>
                <li>• <strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Each restaurant gets adequate locker allocation</li>
                <li>• <strong>Quality Control:</strong> Manageable number for maintaining food standards</li>
                <li>• <strong>Customer Choice:</strong> Enough options without overwhelming decision-making</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Technology Behind the Magic</h2>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our machines maintain food at exactly <strong>60°C</strong>—the optimal temperature for food safety and taste. 
              Unlike traditional cold vending machines, our heating technology ensures every meal is served hot and fresh, 
              just as it would be in a restaurant.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Fresh Food Rotation System</h3>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Food is replenished <strong>4 times per day</strong>:
            </p>

            <ul className="text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-8 ml-6">
              <li>• <strong>Breakfast:</strong> 7:00 AM - Fresh morning options</li>
              <li>• <strong>Lunch:</strong> 11:30 AM - Hearty midday meals</li>
              <li>• <strong>Snacks:</strong> 3:30 PM - Light evening bites</li>
              <li>• <strong>Dinner:</strong> 7:00 PM - Satisfying evening meals</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Each batch stays in the machine for exactly <strong>3.5 hours</strong>, ensuring maximum freshness 
              while minimizing waste. This rotation system means you're never getting day-old food.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Pre-Order Revolution</h2>

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our mobile app allows customers to <strong>pre-order up to 2 hours in advance</strong>. 
              Restaurants can accept or reject orders based on their capacity, and accepted pre-orders 
              get assigned specific lockers while remaining lockers handle walk-up orders.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-700/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">How Pre-Ordering Works:</h3>
              <ol className="text-gray-300 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>1. Browse & Order:</strong> Choose from 4 restaurants on the app</li>
                <li><strong>2. Restaurant Confirmation:</strong> Restaurant accepts based on capacity</li>
                <li><strong>3. Locker Assignment:</strong> Specific locker reserved for your order</li>
                <li><strong>4. Pickup Notification:</strong> App alerts when your meal is ready</li>
                <li><strong>5. Instant Access:</strong> Scan QR code to unlock your locker</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

              <li>• 24/7 availability for all shift workers</li>
            </ul>
